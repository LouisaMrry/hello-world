# hello-world
Hi, I'm Louisa and I am in my first year of university studying Computer Science
"git init";
"git remote add origin (URL FROM THE SSH FROM THE CODE THING)"
How to set up the SSH: follow the instructions; make sure to read ALL of the instructions; need to connect TO the remote repository and thus have to follow the advanced SSH part of the tutorial
Once you have the keys set up, you should clone the remote repository: "git clone (link from SSH)" Enter the passphrase for key. Check whether the remote repository IS actually on the machine. Use the unix command to check.
